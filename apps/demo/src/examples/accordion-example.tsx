            <AccordionContent>
              Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoins by solving complex mathematical
              problems that verify transactions in the currency. When a bitcoin is successfully
              mined, the miner receives a predetermined amount of bitcoin.

            <AccordionTrigger>What equipment do I need?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              You'll need specialized hardware called ASIC miners (Application-Specific Integrated
              Circuits), a reliable power supply, adequate cooling systems, and a stable internet
              connection.

            <AccordionTrigger>How much does it cost to start mining?</AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Initial costs vary widely depending on the scale of your operation. A single ASIC
              miner can cost between $2,000 to $10,000+, plus ongoing electricity costs which can be
              substantial.
