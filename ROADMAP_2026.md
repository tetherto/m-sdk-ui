Q1.1 Define & validate architecture: We’re proposing a design for MDK architecture, and discussing and improving it with the community, to be transparent and align with interested developers.

Q1.2 Start development: We already started working on a new BE SDK implementation, that will include example implementations for open-source community devs, as well as an initial structure to allow open-source devs to start contributing.

Q1.3 Start community engagement: We already started contacting and engaging key industry stakeholders to create a community around MDK as a strong FOSS foundation for the Bitcoin mining industry.

Q1.4 New MDK Landing page: We’re going to deliver a new Landing page to put the public focus on MDK and present MiningOS as our reference implementation.

Q2.1 Extract MOS components: We already started extracting all the components (UI, foundation, domain, feature modules, feature modules, hooks, state management, theme system, etc.) of our internal tool MOS as our initial contribution to the MDK UI Dev Kit.

Q2.2 Restructure endpoints: We are improving the MOS APIs to facilitate moving business logics to the BE and to provide an upgraded version to the community:

Q2.3 Start MDK-based MOS refactoring: Once we have extracted the components and upgraded the API, we’re going to refactor MOS based on MDK, and release it to the community as a 1st reference implementation.

Q2.4 MDK+UI DevKit v1: The partial extrapolation that we have achieved from MOS will be released as v1 of the MDK and UI Dev Kit in Q2.

Q2.5 Publish plugin architecture: Publish the plugin implementation steps along with the required templates to support integration of new device types.

Q3.1 Finalize MDK-based MOS refactoring: The MDK-powered version of MOS is planned to be completed by Q3.

Q3.2 Security audit of MDK-powered MOS: We plan to pass an independent security audit of MDK-powered version of MOS by the end of Q3.

Q3.3 MDK+UIDevKit v2: The full extrapolation that we have achieved from MOS will be released as v2 of the MDK and UI Dev Kit in Q3.

Q3.4 Publish MDK security framework: Establish and document a comprehensive security framework to guide developers and contributors in building secure integrations and applications.

Q3.5 Plugging integration library v1: Add comprehensive documentation outlining the integration of the plugin library and its associated UI components.

Q4.1 MDK+UIDevKit v3: A refined and polished version of MDK and UI Dev Kit will be released by the end of the year.

Q4.2 Plugin Architecture for External Contributions: Provide stable, documented interfaces for device integrations, telemetry handling, and UI extensions and offer templates for new device types and UI components so contributors can quickly bootstrap integrations.
